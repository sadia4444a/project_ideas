# TrustTwin — Investor Pitch Deck

## Making AI Decisions Transparent, Trustworthy & Auditable

---

## Slide 1: The Problem (Hook)

### **AI is Making Billions of Critical Decisions... But Nobody Can Prove They're Right**

**The Reality Today:**

- Banks reject loans using AI — but can't explain _why_ to regulators
- Insurance companies deny claims automatically — customers dispute but there's no clear evidence
- Healthcare systems use AI for diagnoses — but doctors can't verify the reasoning
- Companies face lawsuits, fines, and lost trust because **AI decisions are black boxes**

**The Cost:**

- 💰 $10B+ paid in AI-related fines and legal disputes annually
- ⏰ Thousands of hours wasted manually auditing decisions
- 🚫 Slowed innovation: companies afraid to deploy AI due to compliance risk
- 😤 Customer frustration: "Why was I rejected?" → No good answer

**The Gap:**
Current tools track _model performance_ (accuracy, drift) but **NOT** individual decision explanations, "what-if" scenarios, or bulletproof audit trails.

---

## Slide 2: The Solution — TrustTwin

### **The World's First Decision Twin Platform**

**What We Do (In Simple Terms):**
TrustTwin creates a digital "twin" of your company's decision-making process — a complete, interactive replica that:

1. **Records Everything** — Every automated decision (loan approval, insurance claim, diagnosis) gets a permanent, tamper-proof record
2. **Explains Why** — Uses AI to generate clear, human-readable explanations: "Loan denied because income was below threshold _and_ credit score dropped 50 points"
3. **Simulates "What-If"** — Test scenarios: "What if we changed our policy?" See the impact _before_ you deploy
4. **Proves It's Right** — Cryptographic verification means auditors and regulators can trust your evidence

**In One Sentence:**
_TrustTwin turns invisible AI decisions into transparent, explainable, and legally defensible evidence._

## Slide 3: Why Now? (Market Timing)

### **Three Massive Trends Converging Right Now**

**1. AI Agents Everywhere (2024–2027)**

- Companies deploying millions of AI agents to make decisions automatically
- Every agent decision = a potential lawsuit or compliance issue
- **Problem:** No standard way to audit agent decisions

**2. Regulation Tightening**

- EU AI Act (2024) — requires explainability and human oversight
- US fair lending laws — need proof of non-discrimination
- HIPAA, GDPR, Basel III — all demand decision auditability
- **2026 forward:** Fines increasing 10x for non-compliance

**3. Trust Crisis in AI**

- 78% of consumers don't trust AI decisions (2025 surveys)
- Enterprise customers demanding "show me why" features
- **Companies that can prove their AI is fair will win market share**

**Our Window:**
Next 3–4 years = land-grab opportunity. First mover advantage is _huge_ because enterprises will integrate deeply and switching costs are high.

## Slide 4: How It Works (Simple Tech Overview)

### **Three Core Components**

**1. The Decision Twin (Digital Brain)**

```
Your Business Rules + AI Models + Data
        ↓
TrustTwin builds a Knowledge Graph
        ↓
Interactive simulation environment
```

- Maps _how_ decisions are made (the logic, the data, the models)
- Keeps a version-controlled history

**2. The Explanation Engine**

```
Decision happens → TrustTwin captures context
        ↓
AI generates human explanation
        ↓
Causal engine answers "What if X was different?"
```

- Plain English explanations anyone can understand
- Counterfactuals: "If your income was $5K higher, you'd be approved"

**3. The Verified Ledger (Proof)**

```
Every decision → Cryptographically signed
        ↓
Stored in tamper-proof ledger
        ↓
Export audit-ready evidence in seconds
```

- Like blockchain but enterprise-ready
- Regulators can verify authenticity instantly

**User Experience:**

- Integrate in weeks (not months): plug into your existing systems
- Dashboard shows all decisions, flags risks, generates reports
- One-click export for audits

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape

### **We're Building a New Category**

**Why Current Solutions Fall Short:**

| **Category**             | **Examples**             | **What They Do**            | **What They DON'T Do**                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Monitoring**     | Arize, Fiddler, WhyLabs  | Track model drift, metrics  | ❌ No per-decision explanations<br>❌ No simulation/what-if<br>❌ No legal-grade audit trails   |
| **Explainability Tools** | SHAP, LIME               | Explain model predictions   | ❌ No causal reasoning<br>❌ No continuous monitoring<br>❌ Hard to use for non-technical users |
| **GRC Platforms**        | ServiceNow, MetricStream | General compliance tracking | ❌ Not AI-specific<br>❌ No decision simulation<br>❌ Manual and slow                           |
| **Audit/Logging**        | Splunk, Datadog          | Log events and alerts       | ❌ No AI context<br>❌ No explanations<br>❌ Not tamper-proof                                   |

**TrustTwin = The Only Solution That Does All Four:**

1. ✅ Logs every decision with full context
2. ✅ Explains decisions in plain language + causal "what-ifs"
3. ✅ Simulates policy changes before deployment
4. ✅ Creates cryptographically verified audit evidence

**Our Moat:**

- **Technical:** Unique fusion of knowledge graphs + causal AI + LLM explanations
- **Data:** The more decisions we process, the smarter our explanations become
