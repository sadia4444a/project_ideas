# TrustTwin — AI Decision Trust Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview

**TrustTwin** is a groundbreaking SaaS platform that makes AI decisions transparent, auditable, and legally defensible. We build "Decision Twins" — digital replicas of enterprise decision-making processes that provide complete traceability, explainability, and simulation capabilities.

### The Problem We Solve

Companies are deploying AI to make billions of critical decisions (loans, insurance claims, medical diagnoses), but they can't explain *why* individual decisions were made. This creates:
- **$10B+** in annual compliance fines and legal disputes
- **Trust crisis** with 78% of consumers not trusting AI decisions
- **Innovation blocked** as companies fear deploying AI due to regulatory risk

### Our Solution

TrustTwin creates a complete audit trail for every AI decision with:
1. **Decision Recording** — Tamper-proof ledger of every decision
2. **AI Explanations** — Plain-English explanations anyone can understand
3. **What-If Simulations** — Test policy changes before deployment
4. **Regulatory Compliance** — Audit-ready evidence in seconds
